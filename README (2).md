# Linear Regression on Housing Dataset

This project implements **Simple and Multiple Linear Regression** to predict housing prices using the `Housing.csv` dataset. The model is built using **Scikit-Learn**, visualized with **Matplotlib**, and evaluated with standard regression metrics.

## Files Included

- `Task3_Linear_Regression_Housing.ipynb` – Step-by-step notebook
- `Housing.csv` – Original dataset
- `cleaned_Housing.csv` – Cleaned version after preprocessing
- `README.md` – Project summary and instructions

---

## Objective

To apply regression analysis on a real dataset and interpret the results using proper evaluation techniques.

---

## Libraries Used

pandas  
numpy  
matplotlib  
seaborn  
scikit-learn

## Model Evaluation Metrics

- Mean Absolute Error (MAE)  
- Mean Squared Error (MSE)  
- Root Mean Squared Error (RMSE)  
- R² Score (Coefficient of Determination)

## Workflow Steps

1. Load and clean the dataset  
2. Encode categorical variables  
3. Split into training and testing sets  
4. Train a Linear Regression model  
5. Predict and evaluate  
6. Interpret coefficients  
7. Visualize predictions
